# BDZ-PoCs

This repository contains Proof-of-Concept (PoC) projects developed for demonstrating potential software solutions and UI designs, primarily focused on BDZ (Bulgarian State Railways) related applications.

## Projects

### 1. `bdz-poc-ui`

*   **Purpose:** A rapid UI prototyping application built to showcase potential user interfaces and features for a BDZ online portal. The goal is to quickly create interactive demos as an alternative to static mockups (e.g., Figma).
*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   React
    *   TypeScript
    *   Vite
    *   Material UI (MUI)
*   **Status:** Under development.

## Development Goals

*   **Speed:** Prioritize rapid development and iteration of UI designs.
*   **Modularity:** Build reusable components and maintain a clean project structure.
*   **Interactivity:** Use React and potentially browser storage (`localStorage`) to create stateful demos without a full backend.
*   **Reusability:** Aim for components and structures that could potentially be adapted for the final production application.
